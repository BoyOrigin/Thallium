**Early in development, huge bugs may occur!**  
**A maven wrapper has been provided, no maven distribution is needed!**  
Thallium is a multi-threaded, thread-safe implementation of the Minecraft Server bringing you latest features in the Minecraft platform and Java.  
  
## Building
We use Maven to handle our dependencies. Since we have a maven wrapper, you do not need anything else to run a build.  
Here's the command for your command prompt/terminal. Please execute the commands accordingly on your respective operating systems.  
**WINDOWS ONLY:**
```Shell
mvnw clean package
```
**UNIX ONLY:** 
```Shell
./mvnw clean package

## Sources
This repository contains decompiled source code using a internally renamed minecraft_server.jar, no copyright infringment is intended;   and we will remove the code if required. This code was decompiled by a application called the Mod Coder Pack v9.18 for Minecraft 1.8.8.
